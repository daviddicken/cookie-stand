        Hi, my name is Pat owner and creater of Salmon Cookies. We are a family ran business right out of our home in the great pacific norhwest. You might ask yourself how did you come up with such a great idea as Salmon Cookies, well I'd like to share it with you:

        As a child I had really bad buck teeth and as I got older they got worse. I tried not to smile much because I would scare little kids with my teeth. I couldn't stand the fear in their little eyes as my teeth lurched out at them.
        Then one dark gloomy rainy day in Seattle I was cutting through the Pike Place Market. I wasn't paying attention, had a lot on my mind. I was wondering what it would be like to smile, to just be happy for one minute when Whaaaap!!! I got smacked right in the face with a flying salmon. I went to the bathroom to clean up and couldn't believe my eyes, my teeth were perfect!! I immediately purchased that fish and went home and smacked my wife in the mouth with it and then as soon as the kids got off the school bus that day I wacked them right in the kisser with this 40lbs Chinook Salmon.
        Well as you can see we are a family with perfect teeth.
        I wanted to share this with the world but after a few nights in jail I decided to stop smacking people with my fish. 
        My wife and kids came up with the idea of creating Salmon Cookies so now you to can experience the pleasure of getting smacked in the face with salmon and walk away with perfect.
